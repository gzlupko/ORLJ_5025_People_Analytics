## Useful Code 

### Libraries 

First, one of the most useful libraries recommended when working with data in R in the tidyverse, which is actually a constellation of related packages like ggplot2, dplyr, and stringr. You can load the tidyverse with the following command. 

``` 
library(tidyverse)
```

Alternatively, the following packages that are contained in the tidyverse can be loaded into the R environment as follows. 

```
library(ggplot2) # data visualizations 
library(dplyr) # data manipulation and cleaning 
library(stringr) # manipulating character strings 

```
